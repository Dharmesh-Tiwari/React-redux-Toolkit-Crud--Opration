# React-redux-Toolkit-Crud--Opration
 this repository mainly focuses on data management, we've also included an example of how to integrate routing (using a library like React Router) to showcase how CRUD operations can be linked to different routes.
Simplified State Management: We've utilized Redux Toolkit to simplify the complexities of setting up reducers, actions, and store configuration. This enhances code readability and maintainability.

CRUD Operations: Explore how our codebase handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations seamlessly. We've designed an intuitive UI that interacts with the Redux store to perform these actions without unnecessary complications.
